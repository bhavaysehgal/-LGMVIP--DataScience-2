In this task, you will be asked to predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the userâ€™s very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise in the training set. The same rule applies to the testing set.

KKBOX provides a training data set consists of information of the first observable listening event for each unique user-song pair within a specific time duration. Metadata of each unique user and song pair is also provided. The use of public data to increase the level of accuracy of your prediction is encouraged.
